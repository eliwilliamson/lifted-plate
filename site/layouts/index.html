      <h2>Our Story</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        We are a family-owned and -operated business based in Oakland, CA.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started as owners of an assisted living home in Walnut Creek. This home had been in our family for generations, and had a reputation for its excellent food. We expanded this tradition to include special events – which we styled, managed, and catered to perfection. It wasn’t long before our clients were asking us to plan and cater their own events.
      </p>
      <p>
        With demand for our services increasing, we made the decision to go full time. And so Lifted Plate was born – out of a tradition of excellent service, superior ingredients, sustainable business practices, and impeccable attention to detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        For us, there’s nothing more satisfying than watching an event come to life – complete with laughter, new friends, and full bellies. We truly love what we do. We hope to share our passion and experience with you – to make your event the best and most memorable it can be.
