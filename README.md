# Lifted Plate Marketing Website

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You need to have the latest/LTS [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) versions installed in order to use Victor Hugo.

Next step, clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will take some time and will install all packages necessary to run Victor Hugo and its tasks.

### Development

While developing your website, use:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
gulp server
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/ *- or a new browser windows popped-up already -* to preview your new website. BrowserSync will automatically reload the CSS or refresh the whole page, when stylesheets or content changes.

### Static build

To build a static version of the website inside the `/dist` folder, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To get a preview of posts or articles not yet published, run:

```bash
npm run build-preview
```

See [package.json](package.json#L7) or the included gulp file for all tasks.
